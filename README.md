This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The model uses regression techniques to estimate the price of a house given input features.

Features
Predictive Model: Predicts house prices based on key real estate features.
Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Customizable Model: The model can be customized with different algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluation Metrics: Provides evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score for model performance analysis.
